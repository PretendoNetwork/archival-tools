# VC Manuals
## Download all known Virtual Console manuals as PDFs

## Systems
Each system has a dedicated folder inside the `manuals` folder. The name of the folder is the systems product code:

- `NUS` = Nintendo 64
- `NTR` = Nintendo DS
- `RVL` = Nintendo Wii

It does not appear that NES, SNES, GBA, PC Engine, or TurboGrafx titles have digital manuals. These systems are not currently supported.

## PDFs
The manuals are downloaded as high quality PDFs. The names of the PDFs are as follows `PPPP_RRR_L.pdf` where:

- `PPPP` is the titles product code (`NSMJ`)
- `RRR` is the region (`JPN`)
- `L` is the language (`J`)

The region may be one of:

- `JPN`
- `USA`
- `EUR`
- `CHN`
- `KOR`
- `TWN`

The language may be one of:

- `J` (Japanese)
- `E` (English)
- `F` (French)
- `G` (German)
- `I` (Italian)
- `S` (Spanish)
- `K` (Korean)
- `D` (Dutch)
- `P` (Portuguese)
- `R` (Russian)
- `T` (Traditional)

Some titles may return the English manual if an invalid language is supplied. Therefore there may be instances where duplicate manuals are downloaded under different languages.
